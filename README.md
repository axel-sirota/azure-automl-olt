## Setup

To make the best use of class time, complete the following instructions ahead of class.

    - Youâ€™ll need to provide a credit card to sign up.
    - Select the Free Subscription.
    - Go to https://portal.azure.com and login.
    
3. Create an ML workspace

    - On the top Search Bar type: `Machine Learning` and click the resource saying **Machine Learning** with an erlenmeyer icon
    - Click on **Create Machine Learning workspace** 
    - Under Resource Group click **create new** and type a name. For example, `auto-ml-olt`.
    - On workspace name type something unique. For example, `auto-ml-olt-0001` (use random digits)

    - Once the instance is Running, click on it and Stop it. This is extremely important such that it only runs during the training and you are not being overcharged.

5. Create the compute cluster for the training

    - On the top panel, next to Compute Instance, you will find and click **Compute Cluster**.
    - Click on **New > Next**
    - Type a cluster name like: `azutoml-cluster`
    - Set the maximum number of nodes to 2
